### Overview  
Given an SPM design only structure, this code expands the efficiency estimate functions offered by SPM by a) allowing efficiency estimates to be performed over concatenated sessions, b) by adding a plot of the probabilities that the frequency spectra of regressors falls within certain bounds (e.g. under the high pass filter, within 50 % FWHM of the HRF function), and by computing efficiencies for any combination of contrasts formed from any subset of the entire design matrix (across sessions).  

### To run  
Use run_efficiency_simple.m to go over a basic version of what the functions can do.  Feel free to then adapt for your own purposes.
